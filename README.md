# TableExperiment
This console application makes a table for a random variable
I'm proud of this so i'm uploading it and its radical
I don't know why I used a class 
when I could have placed it all in the main function 
but heyyyyyy it works
and I'm happy :)

ps
the program only works for up to 12 random variable
its probably because I should have used a bigger int or whatever the fuck that means



I don't know what I'm doing
